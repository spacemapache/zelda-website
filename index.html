            <h2>About Hyrule</h2>
            <p>
              Hyrule is a medieval High Fantasy world filled with magic and
              inhabited by many creatures and intelligent races. Hyrule was
              created at the start of time by the three goddesses Din, Nayru and
              Farore who formed it out of swirling chaos. Din "Goddess of Power"
              molded the land with her flaming arms, Nayru "Goddess of Wisdom"
              created science and wizardry and brought order to nature, and
              lastly Farore "Goddess of Courage" through justice and vigor
              created life, the animals and plants to uphold the order.
              <br />
              <br/>
              Their duty complete, the goddesses left behind a small but
              powerful portion of their essence in three golden triangles known
              as the Triforce. Although an inanimate object, each piece of the
              Triforce has the power to bestow one of three titles which gives
              the person who receives them great powers: "The Forger of
              Strength", "The Keeper of Knowledge", and "The Juror of Courage".
              Although the Triforce brought beauty and prosperity to the land of
              Hyrule, it also became the target of bloody conflict both from
              greedy humans as well as demons who sought to corrupt its power
              and recreate Hyrule in their own hellish image. Because of this
              the Triforce was eventually sealed away in a sacred realm, known
              as the Golden Land, whose entrance was obscured and lost to time.
              Since the games takes place on a time frame that easily surpass
              10,000 years between the first and last game in the timeline,
              Hyrule is depicted in very different states depending on the game
              though usually possesses many recognizable landmarks such as Death
              Mountain, Hyrule Field, the Lost Woods and Gerudo Desert.

          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
          industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
          since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
          scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
          five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
          remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
          the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
          more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
          including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
